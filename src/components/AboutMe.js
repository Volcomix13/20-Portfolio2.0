        Hi! I'm glad you've made it to my page! I am here to help you with all your web designing needs.First let me tell you a little bit about myself. I'm a proud El Pasoan living in the utmost edge of West Texas. In 2014 I graduated from The University of Texas at Austin and started working for a brokerage company. A few years later I started becoming interested in web development and began a self teaching course called The Odin Project. I truly enjoyed the content and as I realized there were endless opportunities in the world of coding I decided to embark on this journey and joined UT Austin's coding bootcamp. Take a look at my projects page, there you will find a variety of websites I have worked on!
